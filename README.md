# FontAwesome Rails Helpers

This project provides **lightweight helpers** for using Font Awesome icons in **Rails views**.

## Credits

This project is a fork of the original [font-awesome-sass](https://github.com/FortAwesome/font-awesome-sass) gem, created and maintained by **Travis Chase**.  

Maintained now by **Gierd Team**.

## What's Changed?

Unlike the original gem, which provided full support for Sass and Font Awesome assets, this gem has been **refactored** to include **only the helper methods** for rendering Font Awesome icons in Ruby on Rails views.

If you need the full Sass-powered Font Awesome integration, you can still use the original [font-awesome-sass](https://github.com/FortAwesome/font-awesome-sass).
